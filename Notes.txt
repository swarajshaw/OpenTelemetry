## Why?
Inclusion of various microservices in companies.


Challenges
1. Modelling
2. Troubleshooting
3. Optimizing

Three Pillar
1. Metrics - Important to collect metrics returning to single dashboard
2. Logs - Important to collect logs in a structured manner, identifiers from software such as userid, transactid etc.
3. Distributed Traces - A span represents single unit of work. 

OpenTelemetry 
OpenTelemetry is a collection of tools, APis, and SDKs
Use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces),
to help you analyze your software's performance and behavior.
